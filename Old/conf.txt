CountDownLatch: Suppose a stone can be lifted by 10 people so you will wait for all 10 to come. Then only you can lift the stone.

CyclicBarrier: If you are going to a picnic, and you need to first meet at some common point from where you all will start your journey.

With a latch, the waiters wait for the last arriving thread to arrive, but those arriving threads don't do any waiting themselves.
With a barrier, all threads arrive and then wait for the last to arrive.


Basically it's a shiping and logistic domain project where i am working on tracking api which was developed in jersey rest services and we converted in spring boot application as they do not want dependency on jboss or moving to cloud.

Countdown latch is basically a synchronisation technique which allowes one or more than thhread to wait for cetain set of task to complete
